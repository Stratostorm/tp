## Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add incomplete contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to add contacts without specifying all the fields
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to find contacts by specific fields.
  * What it does: allows the user to find contacts by specifying a 
    specific field to search in by adding `o/OPTION` to the command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user 
    might know exactly what they wish to find and need a quick way to find it. 
    By allowing them to search in the specified field, they can find contacts faster.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
