## Project: ParentPal

ParentPal is a desktop app for managing your childrenâ€™s contacts and their related appointments. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=nicoleang09&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-02-19&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=nicoleang09&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **New Feature**: Added storage for appointment list.
  * What it does: Allows the user to save appointments related to their children in the app across usages. Data is saved in a .json file.
  * Justification: It is essential for users to be able to save their appointments and retrieve them when re-opening the app. This allows users to view and keep track of their upcoming appointments.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to save and apply preferred sorting order of contact list across use sessions.
  * What it does: Allows the user to set their preferred sorting order of the contact list. Preferred sorting order is saved as a user preference. Ordering of contact list is maintained according to preferred sorting order regardless of the commands executed.
  * Justification: This feature makes organising the contact list much easier. Furthermore, users no longer have to enter the sort command after adding or editing contacts to view the newly sorted list. The list will automatically be sorted after a change that might affect the sorting is made.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this enhancement required an analysis of design alternatives. As the contact list was stored as a filtered list that could not be easily sorted, there was a need to consider the tradeoff between the user's convenience and the computation that had to be done by the app. To maintain a sorted contact list that would be easier for the user to view, more computation had to be done every time the contact list changes. An analysis of which commands would likely affect the order of the contact list had to be done to decide when to internally sort the list. 
  
* **Enhancements to existing features**: Extend usage of `help` command.
  * What it does: Previously, this command only displayed a link to the online user guide. Now, the command displays a summary of all available commands. Furthermore, a summary of information about specific commands can also be retrieved.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to get useful information about the commands available without having to leave the application. Internet access is also no longer necessary to get help.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation considerations are documented [here](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w13-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#help-feature). Since the eventual implementation of the command reads and parses information from the user guide, a simple Markdown to plain text converter had to be written.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the `help` feature [\#59](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/59)
    * Updated documentation for the `sort` feature [\#254](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/254)
    * Reorganised the command summary table [\#139](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/139)
    * Organised features into general, address book and appointment book commands [\#139](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/139)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `help` feature [\#98](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/98)
  


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
